**I like to write _super_ stylized text**

~~Sometimes I make mistakes when writing~~

But a wise man named Benjamin Cardozo once said:

>the quest is greater than what is sought, the effort
>finer that the prize (or rather, that the effort is the prize),
>the victory cheap and hollow were it not for the rigor of the game


## Creating this repo

I made this using [Github](https://github.com/)

I had to do a few commands such as:
```
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update readme file"
git push --set-upstream origin add-read-me
```
